🌏 Spatial Data Science for COVID-19
A spatial data science project analyzing COVID-19 through geographic and epidemiological lenses using Python. This project explores COVID-19 patterns across countries, leveraging spatial analytics, geospatial visualization, and data-driven epidemiological insights.

✨ Project Highlights
Spatial Analysis of COVID-19 Patterns – Examine how COVID-19 cases and trends vary geographically over time.
Geospatial Visualizations – Generate maps, choropleths, and heatmaps to visualize global COVID-19 patterns using spatial libraries.
Spatial Data Science Techniques – Apply geospatial analytics, clustering, and spatial trend analysis for meaningful epidemiological insights.

📌 Requirements
Python 3.x (or Anaconda Notebook / Google Colab for fast execution)
Datasets provided.
  Key Libraries:
    geopandas – Spatial data manipulation
    pandas – Data analysis
    matplotlib – Visualization
    folium – Interactive maps
    contextily – Basemaps for spatial plots
    numpy – Numerical computations

Install dependencies via:
    pip install geopandas pandas matplotlib folium contextily numpy
or, for Conda:
    conda install -c conda-forge geopandas folium contextily

📊 Features Demonstrated in the Notebook
    Importing and preprocessing COVID-19 datasets.
    Merging epidemiological data with spatial shapefiles.
    Plotting global and regional COVID-19 distributions.
    Creating choropleth maps to visualize cases, deaths, and trends.
    Performing spatial clustering to identify outbreak hotspots.

🚀 Getting Started
